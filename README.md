# Massively parallel modular computations

This package offers a generic massively parrallel implementation for modular algorithm in computational algebra. In the implementation, the coordination layer and computation layer are separated.  It relays on the task-based workflow  [GPI-Space](http://www.gpi-space.de/) for the coordination of tasks and the computer algebra [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/)
